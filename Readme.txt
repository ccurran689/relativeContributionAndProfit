To use this program a .csv file must be provided in the same folder as the program.

To create this file an excel document can be used to create a file that follows this format. This file can then be exported as a “.csv” file. This file will then have to be in the same location as the executable file.

You will be prompted to input the name of the file (without the .csv) after you run the executable. 

This programme will create a copy of the original document with the added columns (relative contribution and expected profits) and the respective values.
